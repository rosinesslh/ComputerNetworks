

This project is to write your own IP2AS software. It should read in a list of IP addresses from afile, look up the database (DB_091803.txt) to map each IP address to an AS number, andprint out the results to a file (or standard output).



The program is written in java and will be complied with Eclipse.
It will generate "output.txt" as well as print on the console. 
Due to the space character difference, this output.txt should use 
diff -w when compares with the standard output.
