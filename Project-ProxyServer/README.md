# ProxyServer
This project is to create your own Proxy Server thatwill first get requests from users, then compare the target 
website with thesaved cache. If it exists in cache, it will then read the file from cache and send it to the user
(display it in our case).If the site is not in cache, the proxy server will then request the site from the website 
server and save it in cache as well as send it to users.
